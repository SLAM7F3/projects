GARDN notes

*.  Needed to sudo apt-get install libgnome-keyring-dev in order to compile
pwin with gardn enabled.

*.  Modified 'makepwin' script including GARDN and PWGL flags:

cd /home/pcho/sputnik/pwin/build/linux64/
make -s -j pwin OPT=3 OPENCL=1 OPENCV=1 DNN=1 LAPACK=1 RDN=1 WITH_GPU=1 GARDN=1 PWGL=1 GDAL=1 GDAL_PATH=/opt/gdal-2.0.1/


*.  Jim Zin told us on 8/8/16 that both the eufori.dcfg and egm95.grd files
should reside in the folder from which we launch gardn via the following
pwin command:

/home/pcho/sputnik/pwin/build/linux64/pwin -vv -nogpfs -cfg ./eufori.dcfg \
-da gardn


*.  Jim Zin told us that we can see "gardn" projects via flyover admin -->
Fixit --> Binary Build.  .  Look for projects ending with a "_gardn"
suffix 

e.g.  kh_sacramento-acl-rc2-pass2_gardn
      kh_el_paso-acl-rc1-gardn-dev2_gardn
      kh_sacramento-dev2-videdit1_gardn

Enter name of such gardn projects WITHOUT the final "_gardn"
suffix into the Project line of the initial GARDN Editor screen.

*.  Jim Zin highly recommended that we toggle ON (via a mouse double click)
the Read Only option that appears at the bottom of the initial GARDN Editor page.

*.  Jim Zin said that the "Windows" key on our keyboard for our linux
machine is equivalent to the Mac "Command" key on our MacBook laptop.

*.  On 8/8/16, Firefox was able to view the contents of the following XML
file on Thinkmate: 

https://flyover-api.geo.apple.com/FlightOps/project/kh_el_paso-acl-rc1-gardn-dev2/xml

*.  Jim Zin showed us that the initial overview GARDN page on our MacBook
shows the project name
