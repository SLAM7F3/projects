PR Engine 1104 for house number recognition
============================================================================

The first 4 stages of PR engine #1104 are

1.  Extremal region nomination and nested bbox elimination 

2.  Gross bbox grouping

3.  Reduced gross bbox grouping based upon strict CNN digit detection in at
least one bbox per group

4.  Augment # of candidates sent into CNN by slightly expanding surviving
extremal region bboxes.  Perform more lenient CNN recognition of individual
characters.  For each augmented set, retain only candidate recognized digit
with largest matching score.


These first 4 stages of PR engine 1104 appear to work quite well as of Sun,

Stage 5 should perform a new grouping of bboxes with significant digit
recognition scores with little regard to gross bbox grouping from stages 2
and 3.

Stage 6 should perform digits -> numeral detection.
