Hey, the magic words are almost the same as before$(B!D(B


sudo mkdir /mnt/cardassia_fieldtest

sudo smbmount //cardassia/fieldtest /mnt/cardassia_fieldtest -o user=pe16649,dom=MITLL,uid=peter,gid=adm

Enter sudo password when/if "[sudo] password for cho:" shows up

Enter standard LL password when "Password:" shows up


In general, you can use this formula to get to any windows share,
substituting //machine_name/share_name
 

PS In your copious spare time, you may want to $(B!H(Bsudo apt-get install
virtualbox$(B!I(B so you can run a virtual windows inside your ubuntu; it makes
many co-existence tasks much easier, and VirtualBox is easy as hell to set
up.

===================================================================


sudo smbmount //fs1/share /mnt/fs1 -o user=pe16649,dom=MITLL,uid=cho,gid=adm

Need to first supply Ubuntu 10.04 password.  Then need to supply LL e-mail
password.


Notes from Nick Armstrong-Crews about this smbmount command:

"fs1" is the DNS name of the server

"share" is the folder on that server

"/mnt/fs1" is a directory on your local machine where the remote stuff will
now appear (this dir must exist already, or be created)

"user=pe16649" is your Lincoln common ID, or more generally, your username
on the remote machine

"dom=MITLL" is the windows domain

"uid=cho" is the account on your local machine that will get mapped to
(and have the same permissions as) the username on the remote machine

"gid=adm" is the group on your local machine, where N!NHadmN!NI typically has
sudo permissions (this step is probably unnecessary, if your uid already
has sudo permissions)

 

..........................


1.  sudo smbmount //fs1/share /mnt/fs1 -o user=pe16649,dom=mitll

2.  sudo su

3.  cd /mnt/fs1
