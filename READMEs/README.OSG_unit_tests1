==========================================================================

Preliminaries checklist:

0.  On 1st desktop, open vertically short window on RHS for conducting demo.

1.  On 2nd desktop, display full-sized version of copley.jpg:

      view /home/cho/programs/c++/svn/projects/src/mains/OSG/copley.jpg

2.  On 3rd desktop, display 1/2-sized versions of copley.jpg and
    copley_north.jpg:

   view /home/cho/programs/c++/svn/projects/src/mains/OSG/copley.jpg
   view /home/cho/programs/c++/svn/projects/src/mains/OSG/copley_north.jpg

3.  On 4th desktop, display alpha-blended images

  view /data/video/Boston/web_photos/copley_proj_intersection.png
  view /data/video/Boston/web_photos/copley_north_proj_intersection.png

4. Make sure all Cambridge signposts from SKS database have been erased
(none on Draper and none near Kresge)

Single urban environment:
-------------------------

 cd /home/cho/programs/c++/svn/projects/src/mains/OSG
 viewcities --region_filename ./packages/boston.pkg --GIS_layer ./packages/boston_GIS.pkg --region_filename ./packages/copley.pkg --region_filename ./packages/copley_north.pkg


Horizontally resize window so that it fills entire laptop screen (and
projector screen)

  Refer to Cambridge EO image which should be up on side monitors

  Press "A" to insert signposts into ISDS_DEV database.  Transfer
	signpost information (nominations) from 3D <--> 2D.  

	Place signpost on top of Draper lab
	Delsey should place signpost on top of Kresge auditorium

  Press "A" to enter into MANIPULATE_ANNOTATION mode followed by "r"
	to read info from MassGIS databases.

*.  Switch to 2nd desktop to view copley.jpg.  Then switch back to 1st
desktop.

   - Press "U" twice to enter MANIPULATE FUSED DATA mode
   - Press "c" once to display Copley image ObsFrustum
   - Press "f" to fly camera from current location to first ObsFrustum's 
     vertex
   - Press up and down arrows to change alpha blending of Copley image

*.  Switch to 3rd desktop to view both copley.jpg & copley_north.jpg.  Ask how
much overlap exists between two photos.  
   
   - Press "c" again to display two Copley image ObsFrusta
   - Click mouse near 2nd ObsFrustum's vertex to select it and deselect
     first one
   - Press "f" to fly camera to 2nd ObsFrustum's vertex
   - Zoom out from 2nd ObsFrustum.  Double click away from both ObsFrusta
     vertices in order to display both ObsFrusta simultaneously .
   - Press "i" to display intersection sub-volume between both ObsFrusta.

   - Next explain we're really interested in intersection region's overlap
     with world-scene point cloud.  But as a simplifying approximation,
     we'll look at just the red sub-volume's overlap with the ground plane.
     Press "d" to look at ground-plane intersection region.

*.  Switch to 4th desktop to view ground plane triangle region's projection
    into both image planes.  Note correspondence between Boston Public
    library as well as buildings along street corner & park across from
    buildings.


NYC
---

From within mains/OSG subdir, chant "nyroads" which is a script containing
the following two lines:

cd /home/cho/programs/c++/svn/projects/src/mains/neweyork
/home/cho/programs/c++/svn/projects/src/mains/OSG/testcities \
--region_filename ./packages/nyc_rtv_EO.pkg \
--region_filename ./packages/empire.pkg \
--region_filename ./packages/rockefeller_east_crop.pkg \
--region_filename ./packages/empire4_crop.pkg \
--region_filename ./packages/night_empire.pkg \
--region_filename ./packages/piers1.pkg \
--region_filename ./packages/piers2.pkg \
--region_filename ./packages/piers3.pkg \
--region_filename ./packages/piers4.pkg \
--region_filename ./packages/empire_cars.pkg \
--GIS_layer ./packages/nyc_landmarks.pkg \
--ActiveMQ_hostname tcp://155.34.125.216:61616 \
--initial_mode Manipulate_Fused_Data_Mode 

*.  Zoom down into Financial district nearby Wall Street.  Press 'L' to
toggle off purple latitude/longitude grid lines.  Then press '=' once to
increase point size.  Then observe wall content within the RTV NYC data.
Translate virtual viewfrustum north towards Brooklyn Bridge.  Rotate around
bridge & check out its cables.

*.  Translate west away from Brooklyn Bridge.  Once well inside Manhattan
island, press 'L' twice to enter into MANIPULATE LINE mode.  Then press 't'
to toggle roadways on.  Press 'V' to reenter VIEW DATA mode.  Then press
'-' several times (twice) in order to minimize point size.  White roadways
can then be seen peeking through NYC point cloud.  

*.  Translate east back torwards Brooklyn Bridge & observe complicated,
spiraling offramp structure for Brooklyn Bridge freeway.  Translate north.
Zoom out to see most of island and Central Park region.  Press 'L' twice
followed by 't' to toggle off roadways.  

*.  Press 'V' to reenter VIEW DATA MODE.  Then press ',' to change color
map to grey.  Press 'U' twice to enter into MANIPULATE FUSED DATA MODE.
Then press 't' to toggle on 2 colored ObsFrusta for photos taken atop
Rockefeller Center.

*.  Select the blue ObsFrustum with the mouse.  Then Press 'f' to fly to
camera's position on top of Rockefeller Center.  Press up/down arrow keys
several times to compare photo with point cloud background.

*.  Zoom a little bit back from blue photo.  Click with mouse near red
ObsFrustum to see red photo by itself.  Then click back and forth to see
blue and red photos toggling back and forth.  Finally click away from both
to see two photos simultaneously.


Global situational awareness:
----------------------------

After previous nyroads script is terminated, we should still be within the
mains/OSG subdir.


On VISION laptop, chant


cd /home/cho/programs/c++/svn/projects/src/mains/OSG 
earth --GIS_layer ./packages/world_GIS.pkg  \
--region_filename ./packages/baghdad_vision.pkg  \
--newpass /home/cho/programs/c++/svn/projects/src/mains/OSG/HAFB_all.vid \
--surface_texture ./packages/sanclemente_EO.pkg \
--GIS_layer ./packages/SKS_GIS.pkg \
--initial_mode Manipulate_Earth_Mode


If USBdisk #1 is plugged into laptop, we can view preliminary fused EO/3D
Baghdad data set by chanting


cd /media/usbdisk/baghdad/osga/fused_sat_eo
viewcities *.osga


If USBdisk #1 is plugged into laptop, we can view preliminary ground mask
for Baghdad data set by chanting


Note added on 9/13/07:  

p-data in ground_mask files needs to be transfered out of
SecondaryColorArray into FogCoordArray !!!

*.  Mention that we're not using Google Earth.  Mention 3 good reasons why
we're not using Google Earth.

*.  Press "f", enter "boston".  Translate over to Massachusetts state house
area.  Google Earth cannot display true 3D ladar imagery.  Discuss paging
in of tiles and real-time interaction with data.

*.  Press "f", enter "san clemente".

  - Press "A" twice to enter into "MANIPULATE ANNOTATION" mode followed by
   "r" to read in signposts.  Then press ">" multiple times in order to see
   nominations on San Clemente entered earlier in the demo.

  - Press "J" twice followed by "m" twice to display LiMIT model, its
    field-of-regard ObsFrustum and its instantaneous field-of-view ObsFrustum.
    Explain that GMTI dwells are constrained to target nomination sites when
    they're in view of the sensor.

  - Press "R" to enter into "RUN MOVIE MODE" followed by "p" to begin
    animation of LiMIT circling around San Clemente in racetrack orbit. 

  - Press "J" twice followed by "m" once to display Predator model flying
    over island.


*.  Press "E" to return to MANIPULATE EARTH MODE.  Then press "f" followed
    by "baghdad" to fly camera to baghdad.  ( Can toggle between forced
    display/ non-forced display of lat/long grid lines by pressing 'd'.
    Can toggle off sun lighting by pressing "s" within MANIPULATE EARTH MODE.)

  - Press "B" to enter INSERT BOX MODE.  Pick some location in Baghdad map
    with mouse.  Enter "1" for Army symbol identifier.  Press "B" to
    enter MANIPULATE BOX MODE.  Move symbol around with mouse.  Insert
    another red army symbol.
  - Press "H" to insert IED bomb blast nearby some big building
  - Manually move camera over to airport area and view HAFB video.

*.  Zoom out from Baghdad.  Indicate that 0D points, 1D curves and 2D
    nadir photos are handled very well by Google Earth.  But in order to 
    store and manipulate 3D static ladar data and 4D videos, we need a more
    powerful system such as the one we're developing.
