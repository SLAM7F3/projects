*.  Within quadratic_warp/qfit/boston.ive subdir, run program VIEWPOINTS on
each noise tile (e.g. viewpoints boston_30cm.x6.y2_qfit.ive )

*.  Select features at corners of each tile.  Move them radially outward so
that the Delaunay network will be sure to cover every legitimate XY point
in the tile.  Also move them vertically upwards by several meters.  Once at
least the 4 tile corner features have been emplaced, enter into
TRACK_FEATURES mode by pressing "F" and then Delaunay triangulate those
features by pressing "d".  Continue to add features on the tops of tall
structures which are not covered by the triangle network.  

*.  Save all features into their default text files
(e.g. features_3D_boston_30cm.x6.y2_qfit.txt) by entering into
MANIPULATE_FEATURE mode (via the "I" key) followed by pressing "s".  Save
all triangles into their default text files
(e.g. triangles_boston_30cm.x6.y2_qfit.txt) by entering into
MANIPULATE_TRIANGLE model (via the "T" key) followed by pressing "s".

*.  Move the feature and triangle text files into a subdir where main
program TRANSFORM_POINTS can be run (e.g.  transform_points
boston_30cm.x6.y2_qfit.tdp) It takes the noisy TDP file as a direct input,
and it expects to find the feature and triangle files corresponding to the
TDP file in the same subdirectory.  TRANSFORM_POINTS produces a cleaned TDP
file (e.g. boston_30cm.x6.y2_qfit_thresh.tdp).

*.  Run Ross' LODTREE program on the cleaned TDP file to convert it into a
set of .ive files:

./lodtree --separate --pages -o thresh_nosnow/boston.ive
boston_30cm.x6.y2_qfit_thresh.tdp

*.  Move the feature and triangle files for each tile into a subdirectory
for long time storage and possible retrieval 
( e.g. mv *.txt ./features_and_triangles/ )
