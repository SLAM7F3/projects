 LMB's OSG Examples
--------------------

These are some examples I created for learning the Open Scene Graph
(www.openscenegraph.org). Perhaps someone may find them useful.

Comments, suggestions, fixes are welcome. Please contact-me at

I didn't add any licensing terms for this code, but I really don't
intend to sue anyone for using these examples in any way. I have just
one legal note: the font used in some examples ('bluehigl.ttf') was
created by Ray Larabie (www.larabiefonts.com). It is free, but please
check 'FontLicense.txt' for details.

Have fun,

Leandro Motta Barros
