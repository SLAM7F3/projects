*.  Run program NULL_PROBS on satellite model XYZP file in order to
generate an output "null_probs.xyzp" file with all p values set equal to
-1.

*.  Generate initial null weights binary file "weights.null" using program
INITWEIGHTS on output null XYZP file generated by program NULL_PROBS.  P
values are ignored by INITWEIGHTS.

*.  Run program FUSESAT with input 3D XYZP model file, 2D optical image
files, 3D normals XYZP file (press 'r' from data viewing mode in 3D window
to read in surface normals information), 3D and 2D feature files.  Reassign
unique names to shading factor binary files generated by this program
(e.g. shading_factors.3).  Convert draped optical results into pure
intensities by pressing 'i' from data viewing mode in 3D window.  Then save
grey scale values into XYZP output files by pressing 'y' from data viewing
mode.  Rename generic output.xyzp file as grey_foo.xyzp.

*.  Run program VIEWSAT on every greyscale XYZP file.  Perform histogram
specialization by pressing 'e' while in data viewing mode.  Enter 0 as
intensity threshold.  Save renormalized grey scale XYZP output by pressing
'y' from data viewing mode.  Rename generic output.xyzp file as
grey_foo_renorm.xyzp.

*.  Place all input files (i.e. null_probs.xyzp, weights.null,
shade_foo.p, grey_foo_renorm.xyzp) to program COMPSAT into a single
subdirectory (e.g. ./composite/) and make sure that subdir name is
correctly hardwired into COMPSAT.

*.  Run program COMPSAT.  Any shading factors file may be entered as the
counterpart for the initial null_probs.xyzp file.

*.  Perform histogram specification on final composite 3D image by pressing
'e' while in data viewing mode.
