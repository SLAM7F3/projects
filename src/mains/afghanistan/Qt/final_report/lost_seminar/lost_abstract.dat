Abstract:

Maintaining wide-area persistent surveillance within rugged terrain is
challenging for non-nadir looking airborne sensors.  In particular,
mountain occlusion can result in track loss for Ground Moving Target
Indication (GMTI) systems.  To help plan flight routes through viewing
obstacle courses that maximize sensor time on ground regions of interest,
we have developed a line-of-sight software tool which runs in near
real-time.  

In this seminar, we demonstrate how user input to LOST occurs via a simple
web interface, while a second window renders raytracing output in 3D.  LOST
also generates visibility "sky maps" which can guide both manual and
automated flight path planning.  Algorithmic strategies developed by MIT's
Aerospace Controls Lab for rapidly estimating optimal elliptical and
race-track orbits will be discussed.

We close with recent spin-offs from LOST plus future work which include
Thunderstorm exercise modeling, ALIRT imagery incorporation and multi-UAV
mission planning.
