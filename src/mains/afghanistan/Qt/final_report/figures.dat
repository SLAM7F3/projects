1a.  LOST DTED map covering Afghanistan and Pakistan colored according to
terrain height.

1b.  Zoomed view of 3D ground map.  Black holes in terrain indicate missing
IFSAR data.

2.  Firefox web browser window through which nearly all user interactions
with LOST take place.

3.  Communications block diagram for LOST 

 [ Block diagram illustrates thin client request going out via AJAX, Qt
server, 3D thick client, and ActiveMQ message polling ]

4.  Region of Interest entered via 2D map appears as 3D box within the
OpenSceneGraph viewer.

5.  Ground point targets entered via 2D map appear as 3D "Sign Posts"
within the OpenSceneGraph viewer.

6.  Side and top-down views of aerial sensor's minimum and maximum ground
range plus its azimuthal field of regard.

7.  Circular flight path entered via 2D map interface and rendered in the
3D viewer.

8.  Zoomed view in OpenSceneGraph window of 3D model airplane located 
above DTED map mountains.

9.  Custom flight path can be entered by manipulating waypoints within 2D
map interface.

10.  Raytracing ground cells  (Paul drawing)

11a.  Coarse raytracing for speed with visible ground cell (Paul drawing)

11b.  Finer raytracing if necessary with occluded ground cell (Paul
drawing)

12.  Instantaneous terrain visibility results inside a Region of Interest.

13a.  Zoomed view of instantaneous terrain visibility map.

13b.  Rotated 3D map provides views of occluded valley regions.

14.  Time averaged terrain visibility inside a Region of Interest.

15.  Air-to-ground ray colorings.

16.  Point target's visibility over entire flight path.

17.  Some general skymap cartoon (Paul drawing)

18.  Visibility heading skymap depicted as a vector field at the aircraft's
altitude.

19.  Manual flight path planning following visibility skymap.

20.  Elliptical flight path recommended by machine which maximizes view of
three ground targets.

21.  Locations for Afghanistan airfields read in from a shape file.

22.  LOST flight path and ground target info imported via shape file into
Falcon View

23.  Need some screen shot of raster image background appearing on 2D map.

24.  Time averaged Region of Interest visibility exported as a raster image
and draped onto Google Earth DTED.

25.  Terrain visibility map for a panoramic video camera hoisted atop an 80
ft mast.  Raytracing computation was performed using ladar rather than
IFSAR DTED.
