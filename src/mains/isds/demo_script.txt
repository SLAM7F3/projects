Preliminaries checklist:

0.  On 1st desktop, open vertically short window on RHS for conducting demo.

1.  On 2nd desktop, display full-sized version of copley.jpg:

      view /home/cho/programs/c++/svn/projects/src/mains/OSG/copley.jpg

2.  On 3rd desktop, display 1/2-sized versions of copley.jpg and
    copley_north.jpg:

   view /home/cho/programs/c++/svn/projects/src/mains/OSG/copley.jpg
   view /home/cho/programs/c++/svn/projects/src/mains/OSG/copley_north.jpg

3.  On 4th desktop, display alpha-blended images

  view /data/video/Boston/web_photos/copley_proj_intersection.png
  view /data/video/Boston/web_photos/copley_north_proj_intersection.png

4. Make sure all Cambridge signposts from SKS database have been erased
(none on Draper and none near Kresge)

Single urban environment:
-------------------------

 cd /home/cho/programs/c++/svn/projects/src/mains/OSG
 viewcities --region_filename boston.pkg


Horizontally resize window so that it fills entire laptop screen (and
projector screen)

  Refer to Cambridge EO image which should be up on side monitors

  Press "A" to insert signposts into ISDS_DEV database.  Transfer
	signpost information (nominations) from 3D <--> 2D.  

	Place signpost on top of Draper lab
	Delsey should place signpost on top of Kresge auditorium

  Press "A" to enter into MANIPULATE_ANNOTATION mode followed by "r"
	to read info from MassGIS databases.

*.  Switch to 2nd desktop to view copley.jpg.  Then switch back to 1st
desktop.

   - Press "U" twice to enter MANIPULATE FUSED DATA mode
   - Press "c" once to display Copley image ObsFrustum
   - Press "f" to fly camera from current location to first ObsFrustum's 
     vertex
   - Press up and down arrows to change alpha blending of Copley image

*.  Switch to 3rd desktop to view both copley.jpg & copley_north.jpg.  Ask how
much overlap exists between two photos.  
   
   - Press "c" again to display two Copley image ObsFrusta
   - Click mouse near 2nd ObsFrustum's vertex to select it and deselect
     first one
   - Press "f" to fly camera to 2nd ObsFrustum's vertex
   - Zoom out from 2nd ObsFrustum.  Double click away from both ObsFrusta
     vertices in order to display both ObsFrusta simultaneously .
   - Press "i" to display intersection sub-volume between both ObsFrusta.

   - Next explain we're really interested in intersection region's overlap
     with world-scene point cloud.  But as a simplifying approximation,
     we'll look at just the red sub-volume's overlap with the ground plane.
     Press "d" to look at ground-plane intersection region.

*.  Switch to 4th desktop to view ground plane triangle region's projection
    into both image planes.  Note correspondence between Boston Public
    library as well as buildings along street corner & park across from
    buildings.


Global situational awareness:
----------------------------

 cd /home/cho/programs/c++/svn/projects/src/mains/OSG
 earth --region_filename boston.pkg --region_filename /home/cho/programs/c++/svn/projects/src/mains/newyork/nyc_rtv.pkg --region_filename baghdad.pkg --newpass /home/cho/programs/c++/svn/projects/src/mains/OSG/HAFB_all.vid --region_filename sanclemente_EO.pkg



 earth --region_filename /home/cho/programs/c++/svn/projects/src/mains/newyork/nyc_rtv.pkg --region_filename baghdad.pkg --newpass /home/cho/programs/c++/svn/projects/src/mains/OSG/HAFB_all.vid --region_filename sanclemente_EO.pkg

 earth --region_filename boston.pkg --region_filename baghdad.pkg --region_filename sanclemente_EO.pkg --newpass /home/cho/programs/c++/svn/projects/src/mains/OSG/HAFB_all.vid 


*.  Mention that we're not using Google Earth.  Mention 3 good reasons why
we're not using Google Earth.

*.  Press "f", enter "boston".  Translate over to Massachusetts state house
area.  Google Earth cannot display true 3D ladar imagery.  Discuss paging
in of tiles and real-time interaction with data.

*.  Press "f", enter "san clemente".

  - Press "A" twice to enter into "MANIPULATE ANNOTATION" mode followed by
   "r" to read in signposts.  Then press ">" multiple times in order to see
   nominations on San Clemente entered earlier in the demo.

  - Press "J" twice followed by "m" twice to display LiMIT model, its
    field-of-regard ObsFrustum and its instantaneous field-of-view ObsFrustum.
    Explain that GMTI dwells are constrained to target nomination sites when
    they're in view of the sensor.

  - Press "R" to enter into "RUN MOVIE MODE" followed by "p" to begin
    animation of LiMIT circling around San Clemente in racetrack orbit. 

  - Press "J" twice followed by "m" once to display Predator model flying
    over island.


*.  Press "E" to return to MANIPULATE EARTH MODE.  Then press "f" followed
    by "baghdad" to fly camera to baghdad.  ( Can toggle between forced
    display/ non-forced display of lat/long grid lines by pressing 'd'.
    Can toggle off sun lighting by pressing "s" within MANIPULATE EARTH MODE.)

  - Press "B" to enter INSERT BOX MODE.  Pick some location in Baghdad map
    with mouse.  Enter "1" for Army symbol identifier.  Press "B" to
    enter MANIPULATE BOX MODE.  Move symbol around with mouse.  Insert
    another red army symbol.
  - Press "H" to insert IED bomb blast nearby some big building
  - Manually move camera over to airport area and view HAFB video.

*.  Zoom out from Baghdad.  Indicate that 0D points, 1D curves and 2D
    nadir photos are handled very well by Google Earth.  But in order to 
    store and manipulate 3D static ladar data and 4D videos, we need a more
    powerful system such as the one we're developing.
