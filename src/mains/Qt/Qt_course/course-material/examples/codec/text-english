Welcome to the GNU Project web server, www.gnu.org. The GNU Project was
launched in 1984 to develop a complete Unix-like operating system which is
free software: the GNU system. (GNU is a recursive acronym for ``GNU's Not
Unix''; it is pronounced "guh-NEW".) Variants of the GNU operating system,
which use the kernel Linux, are now widely used; though these systems are
often referred to as ``Linux'', they are more accurately called GNU/Linux
systems.
