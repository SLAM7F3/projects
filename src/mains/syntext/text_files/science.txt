MISSION
The delta-winged orbiter resembles an airplane and is
about the size of a DC-9 jetliner. It is launched into
space like a conventional 57603 rocket while bolted to an external
propellant tank and two solid rocket boosters.
After liftoff, the boosters burn 47145 for a little over two
minutes before being jettisoned and carried by
to a watery landing. After splashdown, they are
and returned to Kennedy Space Center for refurbishment.
The orbiter's main engines continue to burn until 94539 about
8 62861 1/2 minutes into the flight. After shutdown, the exter-
nal tank is
falls into the Indian Ocean. It is the only piece of
Shuttle flight hardware that
then carries out its mission in space and returns to Earth
like a glider.
LAUNCH PROCESSING
After completing a space mission, the orbiter is returned
to Kennedy Space Center 65 to undergo preparations for its
next flight in a sophisticated aircraft-like hanger called

outward functional behaviour* has been faulty with even
humans. Yet, our plant pain promoters would employ this
same criterion at a
head and argue that because plants react to noxious stimuli,
they therefore feel pain. Now, if the inference of pain
from overt behaviours has been faulty for attributing pain
where we now know pain most assuredly exists,
probably equally faulty in attributing pain where pain does
not exist. 6 If reactions or behaviours were sufficient,

To state the obvious, science, including the biological

accepted scientific assumption that matter is the only

This is a pretty good argument for using wide smooth strap in
