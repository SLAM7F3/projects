============================================================================
Thinkmate ubuntu 14.4 code changes made on Tues, May 17, 2016:

*.  mains/faces/GENERATE_BBOX_TILES imports an XML file generated by Davis
King's IMGLAB program that contains bounding boxes around objects
(e.g. human faces) for some set of trained images.  Each bounding box
becomes a seed for an image tile with pixel dimensions deeplab_tile_size x
deeplab_tile_size.  If the bbox has pixel dimensions less than
deeplab_tile_size x deeplab_tile_size, the tile is randomly positioned so
as to include the entire bbox.  Otherwise, the tile contains some random
part of the bbox contents.  The user is initially queried to enter the
number of image tiles to generate per bounding box.  The user also supplies
the number of deeplab tiles to generate for images containing zero bounding
boxes.

For each deeplab tile, a mask written to an 8-bit greyscale PNG file is
created whose background value = 0 and foreground value = 1 [, 2, 3, 4...].
Exported image tiles become inputs to Deeplab's DNN, while the masks become
inputs to Deeplab's loss function.

GENERATE_BBOX_TILES also writes out text files containing associations
between image tiles and masks.  It randomly shuffles the associations and
then splits them into training, validation and testing sets.

2016:

*.  Starting to segment new, larger set of face-in-wild images.

..................

*.  Program CLEAN_IMAGES scans through all images within a specified
subdirectory.  It first converts any PNG files into JPG images to avoid
alpha-channel headaches.  It then explicitly checks the number of color
channels within the JPG files.  CLEAN_IMAGES deletes any JPG file which
doesn't have exactly 3 color channels.

We wrote this utility in order to homogenize highly-variable internet
imagery.

Thinkmate ubuntu 14.4 code changes made on Fri, Apr 15, 2016:

*.  mains/syntext/MONTAGE_STRINGS imports a set of synthetic text image
chips and their masks generated by program GENERATE_STRING_IMAGES.  It
ignores any synthetic text chips which are either nontrivially rotated or
contain background underlay bbox content.  MONTAGE_STRINGS composites
together a small random number of text chips within a vertical column

Thinkmate ubuntu 14.4 code changes made on Sun, Apr 10, 2016:

*. mains/syntext/RENAME_BACKGROUND_IMAGES imports a set of raw background
internet image filenames from a specified subdirectory.  It first
alphabetically sorts the input image filenames.  It next wraps the
filenames in double quotes to shield subsequent link commands from white
spaces.  After querying the user to enter the first image's ID,
RENAME_BACKGROUND_IMAGES generates an executable script which copies input
raw filenames to homogenized and ordered output filenames.

============================================================================
Thinkmate ubuntu 14.4 code changes made on Fri, Apr 8, 2016:

============================================================================
Thinkmate ubuntu 14.4 code changes made on Weds, Mar 16, 2016:

*.  Moved contents of program ROTATE_STRING_IMAGES() into
textfunc::rotate_image_and_mask().  CREATE_STRING_IMAGES now calls
rotate_image_and_mask() as its last step.

============================================================================
Thinkmate ubuntu 14.4 code changes made on Tues, Mar 15, 2016:

*.  Program mains/syntext/MOVE_SMALL_BACKGROUNDS imports all image files
from a specified folder.  It retrieves each image's width and height in
pixels.  If either the pixel width or height is less than
composite_tile_size, the image is moved into a "small_pics" subdir of the
input folder.

We wrote this little utility in order to ensure all background internet
image inputs to program to COMPOSITE_STRING_TILES are sufficiently large
for semantic segmentation purposes.

..............

*.  Semantic segmentation of strings in the wild is starting to show some
promise!

*.  mains/syntext/PHRASES now randomly intersperses house numbers among

============================================================================
Thinkmate ubuntu 14.4 code changes made on Mon, Mar 14, 2016:

*.  Synced with m6700.

*.  Starting to generate large set of composited synthetic text tiles.

................

*.  Program COMPOSITE_STRING_TILES imports a set of synthetic text chips
and their masks generated by program ROTATE_STRING_IMAGES.  It also takes
in a set of background internet photos which should contain no text
content.  COMPOSITE_STRING_TILES generates a specified number of output
tiles whose pixel size is consistent with deeplab semantic segmentation
network finetuning.

Each composite tile contains 3x3 individual tiles.  A random internet image
is first laid down as a background for the entire composite tile.
Foreground chips output by ROTATE_STRING_IMAGES are then superposed onto
the background texture.  The upper left corner of the very first foreground
chip is randomly placed inside the composite tile's upper left individual
tile.  Subsequent foreground chips are laid down the background chip with
care taken that they never overlap a previous foreground chip.

Average foreground and background RGB values are calculated for each image
chip before it's superposed.  If their color contents are not sufficiently
different, the candidate foreground chip is rejected and another random
chip is selected.  ImageMagick is used to iteratively superpose foreground
chips onto the background composite.  An 8-bit greyscale mask is also
iteratively constructed which displays the location of all synthetic text
within the entire composite.  Once generation of a composite image and mask
is completed, they are decomposed into 3x3 individual tiles.

Individual tiles and masks are exported to separate folders, and their
associations are recorded within text files.  20% of the tile/mask pairs
are reserved for DNN finetuning validation.  A shuffled set of training and
testing tile/mask filename pairs are written to text files which are needed
as inputs for Deeplab.  A final set of tile and mask chips are also
exported to a deeplab_inputs folder so that they can be more easily
uploaded to Titan GPU machines for Deeplab processing.

.............

============================================================================
Thinkmate ubuntu 14.4 code changes made on Sun, Mar 13, 2016:

*.  mains/syntext/CREATE_STRING_IMAGES now generates string images with

nontrivial fraction of input string images.

============================================================================
Thinkmate ubuntu 14.4 code changes made on Fri, Mar 11, 2016:

*.  mains/syntext/ROTATE_STRING_IMAGES imports a set of synthetic string
images and masks generated via program CREATE_STRING_IMAGES.  For each
image, it instantiates a virtual camera whose horizontal FOV and aspect
ratio are random gaussian variables.  The string image and mask are also
rotated in 3 dimensions according to random az, el and roll gaussian
variables.  After perspectively projecting the string image and mask into
the virtual camera, ImageMagick is used to generate and export their 2D
imageplane renderings.

============================================================================
Thinkmate ubuntu 14.4 code changes made on Thurs, Mar 10, 2016:

*.  mains/syntext/CREATE_STRING_IMAGES appears to be correctly generating

============================================================================
Thinkmate ubuntu 14.4 code changes made on Mon, Mar 7, 2016:

*.  mains/syntext/PHRASES imports a set of text files.  Looping every line
in each file, PHRASES first removes any special characters such as .,;:'".
It then retrieves 2 - 15 words from the cleaned lines.  The cleaned
"phrases" are exported to an output text file.

*.  mains/syntext/COMPANY_NAMES combines female and male first names with
last names in order to synthesize reasonable-sounding full names.  Some
full names are randomly spelled with all capital letters.  Others have
their first and/or middle names replaced with initials.

============================================================================
Thinkmate ubuntu 14.4 code changes made on Sat, Mar 5, 2016:

create_string_images.cc in order to better match text in wild sizes.

============================================================================
Thinkmate ubuntu 14.4 code changes made on Thurs, Mar 3, 2016:

*. mains/syntext/SUPERPOSE_CHIPS imports a set of synthetic text chips and
their masks generated by program CREATE_STRING_IMAGES.  It also takes in a
set of background internet photos which should contain no text content.
SUPERPOSE_CHIPS generates a specified number of output tiles whose pixel
size is consistent with deeplab semantic segmentation network finetuning.

For each tile, this program randomly selects a non-text background.  It
next randomly picks 1, 2, 3 or 4 string image chips to superpose on the
tile background.  If more than one string is superposed on a tile,
SUPERPOSE_CHIPS tries to separate them in the vertical direction so as to
minimize multi-string overlap.  An 8-bit greyscale mask is generated for
each tile which marks the location of all synthetic text within the overall
tile.

Tiles and masks are exported to separate folders, and their associations
are recorded within text files.  20% of the tile/mask pairs are reserved
for DNN finetuning validation.  A shuffled set of training and testing
tile/mask filename pairs are written to text files which are needed as
inputs for Deeplab.  A final set of tile and mask chips are also exported
to a deeplab_inputs folder so that they can be more easily uploaded to
Titan GPU machines for Deeplab processing.
