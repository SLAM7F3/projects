TOUCHY code changes made on Mon, Jun 16:

*.  Added draw_central_bbox_flag to Movie::export_current_subframe()
methods and G99VD::retrieve_curr_subframe_byte_data().  If boolean flag ==
true, latter method calls G99VD::generate_central_bbox().

============================================================================
TOUCHY code changes made on Fri, Jun 13, 2008:

*.  Added few more comments to README.bluegrass_demo

*.  Hacked mains/bluegrass/AVS/qtcities.cc to instantiate VideoServer for
June RCO program review.

============================================================================
TOUCHY code changes made on Thurs, Jun 5, 2008:

*.  In Movie class, changed georegister_subtexture_corners() and
export_current_subframe() from void to bool methods.  They now return false
if the input longitude-latitude bbox coords are nonsensical.  

*.  Movie::georegister_subtexture_corners() explicitly computes all bbox
corner UTM coords within same UTM zone.

TOUCHY code changes made on Sun, Nov 11:

* Rejecting candidate ground points based upon their proximity to the
estimated bald earth surface badly fails for complicated, multi-valued
ground regions such as bridges and cloverleaf on-ramps.  So new version of
groundfunc::eliminate_ground_outliers() compares candidate ground points to
their neighboring ground points.  It reclassifies any candidate whose
height differential is too large as not ground.

============================================================================
TOUCHY code changes made on Mon, Nov 5:

*. Added upper limit on ground_prob within
groundfunc::identify_ground_seed_pixels() which doubles if not enough
ground seeds are found.

============================================================================
TOUCHY code changes made on Mon, Oct 29:

*.  TwoDarray::fast_px_to_x() and fast_py_to_y() do not perform any
in-bounds or finite value checking.  So they should run faster than their
safer px_to_x() and py_to_y() counterparts.

*.  Tried to streamline groundfunc::generate_threshold_field() so that it
doesn't run horribly slow for mbins=nbins=40.

*.  Moved multiple repetitive actions out of main program findground into
groundfunc::generate_zground_twoDarray(),
generate_thresholded_flattened_height_map() &
refine_ground_mask_estimate().  Findground now explicitly iterates over
oozing, threshold lattice sampling, threshold field formation, flattening &
ground mask refinement.

============================================================================
TOUCHY code changes made on Weds, Oct 3:

*.  In PickHandler class, increased max doubleclick time spread to 0.35 for
DiamondTouch operation; Check screen space separation between two pushes is
small as well as time differential before declaring a doubleclick event.

============================================================================
TOUCHY code changes made on Friday, Sep 21

*.  Eliminated MyViewerEventHandler dependence upon SceneView.

============================================================================
TOUCHY code changes made on Tuesday, Sep 18

*.  Added README.DT_on_touchy in mains/newyork

============================================================================
TOUCHY code changes made on Tuesday, Aug 28:

*.  Added PassesGroup member to GraphicalsGroup class.  Eliminated
PassesGroup member from FusionGroup class.

*.  Eliminated unused constructor in FusionGroup class.  Added
OBSFRUSTAGROUP member var to FusionGroup class.

*.  Added changes_touchy.txt to repository.
