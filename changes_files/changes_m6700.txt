*.  mains/imagetext/CREATE_CHAR_IMAGES can now generate reasonable 32x54
synthetic digit image chips.

*.  mains/imagetext/SVHN_PIXEL_SIZES scans through SVHN image chips and
extracts their pixel widths and heights.  It then computes and exports the
probability densities for SVHN image chip pixel widths and aspect ratios.
When this program is run on O(40K+) SVHN chips, it finds that the aspect
ratio distribution is nearly gaussian with mean = 0.62 and standard
deviation = 0.11.  Pixel widths appear to follow an approximate decaying
exponential distribution which has a lower cutoff at width_lo = 23.

uniform pixel size, borders will be dynamically added as necessary
to each input image so that effectively all images end up with the
same pixel widths and heights.

DRAWMASKS enables users to draw polygons around objects of interest within
an input set of random images.  Polygon information for each image can be
exported to an output text file and later reimported into DRAWMASKS.

*.  Trying to streamline mains/imagetext/GENERATE_CHAR_IMAGES.

============================================================================
Dell M6700 code changes made on Mon, Sep 1, 2014:

*.  mains/imagetext/GENERATE_FONT_IMAGES loops over all ttf font files
within a specified subdirectory.  For each font, it generates an output
image containing all digits, lower case and upper case letters.  We wrote
this utility program in order to identify "reasonable" fonts for synthetic
character generation purposes.

============================================================================
Dell M6700 code changes made on Sun, Aug 24, 2014:

*. Most ISDS demo programs (except for LOST) now work acceptably well
(pfiles8_24a.tgz).  

============================================================================
Dell M6700 code changes made on Mon, Aug 11, 2014:

*.  Restored geofuncs.cc to pre-July 15 version.  Always set D = Dminus =
-dotproduct-sqrt(discriminant) which corresponds to closest intercept point

again after this code reversion.

============================================================================
Dell M6700 code changes made on Sun, July 13, 2014:

*.  Continuing to systematically minimize warning messages from main
programs.

*. Most ISDS demo programs (except for LOST) now work acceptably well

============================================================================
Dell M6700 code changes made on Sat, Jul 12, 2014; early Sun, July 13, 2014:

*.  Starting to systematically minimize warning messages from main
programs.

*. Most ISDS demo programs (except for LOST) now work acceptably well
(pfiles7_13b.tgz)

============================================================================
Dell M6700 code changes made on Sat, Jul 5, 2014; early Sun, Jul 6, 2014:

*.  Overloaded FeaturesGroup::extract_feature_chips() is designed to work
with manually-specified bbox corner pairs.  Looping over images, this
method imports their originally-sized jpg files.  It extracts a bounding
box chip for each pair of feature corners which overlap with the current
image.  Bbox chips are written to the specified chips_subdir with filenames
that begin with the specified chip_prefix.

============================================================================
Dell M6700 code changes made on Weds, July 2, 2014, Fri, July 4, 2014:

*.  FeaturesGroup::renormalize_feature_coords() converts all feature
coordinates from common, multi-image U,V coordinates to individual image
(u,v) coordinates.  The renormalized feature coordinates are written to an
output text file.

*.  Reworked texture_rectangle::read_next_photo() so that it no longer
calls faulty ImageMagick convert in order to center smaller images inside
max sized image.  Also now add a dark grey (but not invisible black) border
around centrally embedded smaller images.  VIEWIMAGES now appears to work
correctly on an input set of arbitrarily sized images.

============================================================================
Dell M6700 code changes made on Sat, Jun 28, 2014; early Sun, Jun 29, 2014:

*.  Starting to implement Nister's method for computing connected
components tree.

============================================================================
Dell M6700 code changes made on Thurs, Jun 26, 2014; Fri, Jun 27, 2014; 
Sat, Jun 28, 2014:

*. Most ISDS demo programs (except for LOST) now work acceptably well
(pfiles6_26a.tgz).  

...................

*.  Significantly overhauled and streamlined text_detector class.  But
tree recognition in aerial flyover images is still very slow!

*.  mathfunc:: contrast_normalize_histogram() takes in an array of H
floats.  It first computes the mean and standard deviation of the H floats.
It next subtracts the mean from each histogram component and divides by the
standard deviation.  The output histogram values have mean 0 and unit
standard deviation.

*.  Reimplemented disjoint_set container class which works with unsigned
ints ranging from 0 to n-1.

============================================================================
Dell M6700 code changes made on Tues, Jun 24, 2014:

*.  Trying to streamline text_detector class as much as possible.

============================================================================
Dell M6700 code changes made on Sun, Jun 22, 2014 & early Mon, Jun 23,
2014:

*.  mains/flyover/aerial_recog/SEGMENT_IMAGES imports the dictionary
generated by program DICTIONARY, inverse square root of the whitening
covariance matrix generated by program WHITEN_DESCRIPTORS, and the
probabilistic decision function generated by program SVM_RECOG.  Looping
over some input set of test images, this program moves a sliding window and
computes its 9K-dimensional feature vector.  It then effectively dots the
feature vector with the components of the linear SVM classifier weight
vector.  If the dotproduct exceeds a user-specified threshold fraction, the
sliding window is declared foreground and colored purple within an output
mask image.

============================================================================
Dell M6700 code changes made on Sat, Jun 21, 2014 & early Sun, Jun 22,
2014:

*.  Added set_display_curr_bbox_flag member to FeaturesGroup along with
set/get methods.

*.  Renamed mains/JAV/build_HOG_dictionary.cc as construct_HOG_dictionary.cc
in order to avoid copying executable via copyprojfiles command.

.....................

*.  FeaturesGroup::display_selected_feature_bbox() first purges all
PolyLines in *PolyLinesGroup_ptr.  It then retrieves the currently
selected feature's UV imageplane location.  A new PolyLine bbox is
formed around the selected feature's location whose side dimensions
correspond to bbox_sidelength measured in pixels.

We wrote this member function in June 2014 in order to facilitate
picking tree, building, road etc patches in aerial imagery of
different length scales.

*.  Added mains/flyover/aerial_recog/ subdir to repository

============================================================================
Dell M6700 code changes made on Weds, Jun 18, 2014:

*.  In texture_rectangle::read_next_photo(), we now explicitly check
whether next_photo_filename.size()==0 BEFORE trying to retrieve its
width and height.  This fixes the catastrophic failure in VIDEO, VIEWCITIES
& TESTCITIES which we discovered yesterday.

============================================================================
Dell M6700 code changes made on Tues, Jun 17, 2014:

*.  Isolated problem with VIDEO & VIEWCITIES to newish version of
texture_rectangle::read_next_photo().  Temporally reverting to old version.

*. Most ISDS demo programs (except for LOST) now work acceptably well
(pfiles6_17c.tgz).  

============================================================================
Dell M6700 code changes made on Mon, Jun 16, 2014:

*.  In GraphicalsGroup class, added bool flags
erase_Graphicals_forward_in_time_flag and
erase_Graphicals_except_at_curr_time_flag with default false values and
setter methods.

*.  In GraphicalsGroup::initialize_Graphical(), check if either of these
new flags == true.  If so, temporally erase Graphicals.

*.  Feature picking enabled among multiple images via program VIEWIMAGES.

............

*.  VIDEO, VIEWCITIES and TESTCITIES are not working !!!

============================================================================
Dell M6700 code changes made on late on Sat, Jun 7, 2014 and early on Sun,
Jun 8, 2014:

*.  Generalized mains/video/VIEWIMAGES to handle displaying a sequence of
input images with varying pixel widths and heights.

*.  mains/imagetext/DETECT_TEXT imports the dictionary generated by program
DICTIONARY, inverse square root of the whitening covariance matrix
generated by program WHITEN_DESCRIPTORS, and the probabilistic decision
function generated by program SVM_TEXT.  Looping over some input set of
testing image chips, this program then extracts 9K-dimensional feature
vectors and effectively dots them with the components within the linear SVM
classifier weight vector.  If the dotproduct exceeds a user-specified
threshold fraction, the input test image is classified as "text".
Confusion matrix results are calculated and written to text file output.

============================================================================
Dell M6700 code changes made on Sat, Jun 7, 2014:

*.  imagefunc::get_image_width_height() now works with unsigned ints rather
than ints.

*. No longer compile deprecated file delaunay/delaunay.cc.  Commented out
several methods within voronoifuncs.cc which depend upon the deprecated
delaunay methods.  

*. Most ISDS demo programs (except for LOST) now work acceptably well
(pfiles6_7b.tgz).  

============================================================================
Dell M6700 code changes made on Fri, May 30, 2014; Sat, May 31, 2014:

*.  mains/video/VIEWIMAGES is a minor variant of VPLAYER.  It can be used
to scan through all image files contained within the present working
directory.  The image files are assumed to have uniform pixel size, but
they do not need to have been ripped from a common video clip.

VIEWIMAGES enables users to annotate individual images and export all such
annotations to CSV text files.

============================================================================
Dell M6700 code changes made on Weds, May 28, 2014:

*. Most ISDS demo programs (except for LOST) now work acceptably well
(pfiles5_28a.tgz).  

============================================================================
Dell M6700 code changes made on Sat, May 24, 2014, Sun, May 25, 2014; Mon,
May 26, 2014:

*.  mains/imagetext/INITIAL_DESCRIPTORS loops over all input image files
within raw_char_subdir.  It extracts n_patches_per_image 8x8 pixel patches
from each image.  It converts the 8x8 patches into a 64x1 column vector of
grey-scale intensities.  Raw descriptors for all character image patches
are "contrast normalized" and then exported to a single HDF5 binary file.

*.  mains/imagetext/WHITEN_DESCRIPTORS imports contrast normalized 64x1
descriptors for 8x8 pixel patches selected from character jpeg images
generated by program INITIAL_DESCRIPTORS.  It computes the descriptors'
covariance matrix along with a regularized version of its inverse square
root covariance matrix.  Each input descriptor is whitened by multiplying
it by the inverse square root covariance matrix.  Whitened patch
descriptors are exported to a single HDF5 binary file.

*.  mains/imagetext/DICTIONARY imports whitened 64x1 descriptors generated
by program WHITEN_DESCRIPTORS for 8x8 pixel patches randomly selected from
text character images.  It initially fills dictionary matrix D with column
vectors populated via a Normal distribution and normalized to unit
magnitude.  It then iteratively updates score matrix S and dictionary D
following the prescription laid out in "Learning feature representations
with K-means" by Coates and Ng, 2013.  After each iteration, a PNG file is
generated which illustrates all K 8x8 dictionary elements.  The final
values in D are exported to a binary HDF5 file.

.............

*. Most ISDS demo programs (except for LOST) now work acceptably well
(pfiles5_27a.tgz).  

============================================================================
Dell M6700 code changes made on Sat, May 10, 2014 and early Sun, May 11,
2014:

*.  RGB_analyzer::print_color_histogram() loops over all entries within an
input color histogram whose size must equal get_n_color_indices().  It
sorts the color histogram in descending order and ignores any values less
than 1%.  The remaining entires are printed out alongside their color
names.

*.  RGB_analyzer::initialize_color_metric() instantiates color metric
matrix *M_color_ptr which contains manually assigned overlap between
quantized colors.  Each color is assigned unit overlap with itself.  The
color metric also assigns "alpha" overlap between "single-hop" colors in
HSV space.  For example, M_color("red","lightred") =
M_color("lightred","greyred") = M_color("greyred","darkred") =
M_color("darkred","red") = alpha.  Similarly, M_color("red","orange") =
M_color("orange","yellow") = M_color("white","lightgrey") = alpha.

Using some judgment, we also assign "sqr(alpha)" overlap between most (but
not all) "double-hop" colors in HSV space.

============================================================================
Dell M6700 code changes made on Sat, May 10, 2014:

*. Most ISDS demo programs (except for LOST) now work acceptably well

(pfiles4_26c.tgz).  In particular, raytrace program works OK again.

============================================================================
Dell M6700 code changes made early on Fri, Apr 18, 2014:

*.  Eliminated bbox member of extremal_region and connected component
structures within mains/flyover/EXTREMAL_NUMBERS in favor of lighter-weight
min_px,max_px,min_py,max_py members.

============================================================================
Dell M6700 code changes made late on Sat, Apr 12, 2014; Sun, Apr 13, 2014:

*.  mathfunc::intersect_sorted_integers() takes in 2 sorted-integer sets A
& B of lengths l_a and l_b.  It returns within *A_and_B, *only_A and
*only_B the decomposition of the 2 input integer sets.  It also returns the
sizes of these decomposed integer sets.

*.  mains/flyover/EXTREMAL_REGIONS now computes pixel perimeters and
number of holes for all extremal regions/connected components.

*.  EXTREMAL_REGIONS now exports colored images illustrating connected
components tree.

============================================================================

programs seem to work OK.  Probably something is going wrong with
SIFT matching.

*.  In mathfuncs::find_local_peak(), changed

      int n_peak_bin=-1;

to

      int n_peak_bin=0;

GEO viewer then seems to work OK after this fix.
